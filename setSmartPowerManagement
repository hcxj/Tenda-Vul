Vulnerability Description
Vendor: Tenda
Product: AC6
Version: V15.03.05.16
Type: Buffer Overflow
Firmware link: https://www.tenda.com.cn/material/show/102661

Vulnerability Details
The function "setSmartPowerManagement" retrieves the parameter "time" using "sub_2B7C4", the value of "time" is formatted using the sscanf function with the format "%[^:]:%[^-]-%[^:]:%s". 
This greedy matching mechanism is insecure, as it can cause a stack overflow if the size of the data we enter exceeds the sizes of "v10", "v9", "v8", or "v7".
